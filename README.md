# Advanced Type Racer Bot
Simply install the required packages and you'll be fine! Little disclaimer the accuracy only doesn't completely carry over into type racer itself. <br>

To install the required packages use this command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Features
1. Support for most browsers!
2. Decent-looking GUI which shouldn't be too hard to use
3. Changeable Keybinds!
4. Support for Dark Mode, Light Mode, and the System Default

## Things to be added in the future
- Captcha solving, currently the bot can't solve the type racer captcha
- Unlimited mode, basically removed the bots default delay in order to achieve an ultra-fast speed
- Change the GUI font, honestly the one right now is pretty ugly
- Split up the code into multiple files, just to make it easier to read
- Support for the user to type for a bit then the bot finishes the rest
- Login support, the bot will encrypt and store your password and then log in for you
